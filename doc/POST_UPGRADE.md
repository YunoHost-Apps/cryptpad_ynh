We have added a sandbox domain for you but you still need to configure your DNS and generate Let's Encrypt Certificates for it !!
If not already done, then you can please open CryptPad domain: https://__DOMAIN__

Create an account via the Register button on the home page. To make this account an instance administrator:
1. Copy the public key found in User Menu (avatar at the top right) > Settings > Account > Public Signing Key
2. Paste this key in __INSTALL_DIR__/config/config.js in the following array (uncomment and replace the placeholder):
adminKeys: [
        "[cryptpad-user1@my.awesome.website/YZgXQxKR0Rcb6r6CmxHPdAGLVludrAF2lEnkbx1vVOo=]",
],
If you are facing an issue or want to improve this app, please open a new issue in this project: https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/cryptpad_ynh"
